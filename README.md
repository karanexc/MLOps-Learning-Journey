# 📚 My MLOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) learning repository! This project documents my step-by-step journey as I learn and apply MLOps concepts, tools, and best practices. I believe in **learning by doing** and sharing knowledge publicly to stay accountable and help others.

## 🚀 About This Project

MLOps is a crucial discipline that combines Machine Learning with DevOps principles to streamline the entire ML lifecycle — from data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring. This repository contains:

- Detailed notes and explanations from each learning session
- Jupyter Notebooks with summaries, code snippets, and reflections
- Links to resources like videos, articles, and tutorials
- Step-by-step guides on tools like DVC, MLflow, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Version-controlled datasets and model files (when applicable)

---

## 📅 Learning Roadmap

- Be familiar with Linux commands.
- Git and github
- DVC Pipeline tracking
- Cloud Platform for MLOps
- MLFlow Experiment Tracking
- Docker for MLOps
- Amazon Sagemaker
- Monitoring with Grafana
